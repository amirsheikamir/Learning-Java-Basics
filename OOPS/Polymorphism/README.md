# Polymorphism : 
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
***
 ## Types of Polymorphism 
  - Compile Time Polymorphism : compile time decide which constructor take.

      Poly - many 
      morphism - forms 
       - method overriding : Two methods having same name but diff. arguement, data type of arguement.
  
- Runtime Polymorphism : 
  1. when you have 2 functions of same name & same parameter.

---

Overloading : same name , diff arguements same calss , diff class
---

Overridding : same func error come duplicate method
