# Polymorphism : 
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
***
  * Poly - many 
     *  morphism - forms 
 ## Types of Polymorphism 
 > Compile Time Polymorphism : compile time decide which constructor take.
       - method overriding : Two methods having same name but diff. arguement, data type of arguement. 
> Runtime Polymorphism : 
 >  when you have 2 functions of same name & same parameter.

Overloading : same name , diff arguements same calss , diff class
---

Overridding : same func error come duplicate method
