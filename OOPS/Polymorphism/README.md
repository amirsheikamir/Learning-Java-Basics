# Polymorphism : 
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
***
 ## Types of Polymorphism 
  - compile time Polymorphism. : compile time decide which constructor take.
  ---

      Poly - many 
      morphism - forms 
       * method overriding : Two methods having same name but diff. arguement, data type of arguement.
  
- Runtime Polymorphism : 
  1. when you have 2 functions of same name & same parameter.



over-loading : `same name , diff arguements same calss , diff class`
---

over-ridding : same func `error come duplicate method`
