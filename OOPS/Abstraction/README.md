# Abstraction : 
        Abstraction in Java is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only the functionality to the user.There are two class 
  
   ### Abstraction in Java can be achieved using the following tools it provides :
 
   1. Interface  : 
            supports multiple inheritance : 
            // remember java doesn't support multitple inheritance but in Inheritance it supports 

            Blueprint of a class 
            it actually start with 
                *interface I {

                    void hello ()  
                    void solve()
                    void run();
                }

   2. Abstract Class : 


        abstract class inf {

            // abstract methods
        abstract void run();
        abstract void hello();
        int x;
        }
