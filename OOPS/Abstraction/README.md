# Abstraction : 
        Abstraction is a way of hiding the unecessay details from user. 
  
   ### Abstraction in Java can be achieved using the following tools it provides :
        Both are used to achieve abstraction.
 
   1. Interface  :  It only has abstraction methods. And supports multiple inheritance : 
       - remember java doesn't support multitple inheritance but in interface it supports 

            Blueprint of a class 
            it actually start with 
                
                interface I {

                    void hello ()  
                    void solve()
                    void run();
                }

   2. Abstract Class : It can have both abstract and non abstract methods.

    ```
     abstract class inf {

        abstract void run();
        abstract void hello();
        int x;

        }
    
    ```
