//  Rule 1 - > Must file name is same is class name in my case Main is the class name
//  Rule 2 -> Every program it will have a main function if main function is is not their program will not run. 
//  Rule 3 -> Static functions they don't require objects to run them (they can run without key)
//  Rule 4 -> Non-Static functions they require  objects to run them   (They require key to run)
 object is like a key

 public class Main 
 {
     // public --> This function can used to run program (They can run without key)
      // static --> Currently it is a static function, (they don't require objects to be run )
     //  void -> return is void which means this function will not return anything 
     //  main -. function name ............
     //  String arg[] -. In array we will study this part later 
     //  keyword is special meaning in java eg, ( public, class void ,String )

    // class is like a blueprint 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
    	// print -> if we write print only it only prints 

        System.out.println("Hacker's On Earth!");

        System.out.print("Woow i Learned how to print in java");

        // println --> (it will print first and then change the  next line )  
    
        System.out.println ("Getting in to Hacking ");
          
    }
