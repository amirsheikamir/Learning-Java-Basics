# LinkedList 
    A linked list is a collection of “nodes” connected together via links. These nodes consist of the data to be stored and a pointer to the address of the next node within the linked list. In the case of arrays, the size is limited to the definition, but in linked lists, there is no defined size. 

 ## How it works Internally.
   -  Every Node connected to each other via links.
   -  Referece variable head and tail head points to first node and tail pointing the last one. 

  code : 
   ``` java
            clean Node {
                int val;
                Node next;
            }
